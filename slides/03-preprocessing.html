Today we’ll talk about preprocessing and featureengineering. What we’re talking about today mostly
applies to linear models, and not to tree-based
models, but it also applies to neural nets and kernel
SVMs.

Let’s go back to the boston housing dataset. The idea
was to predict house prices. Here are the features on
the x axis and the response, so price, on the y axis.

What are some thing you can notice? (concentrated
distributions, skewed distibutions, discrete variable,
linear and non-linear effects, different scales)

Let’s start with the different scales.

Many model want data that is on the same scale.
KNearestNeighbors: If the distance in TAX is
between 300 and 400 then the distance difference in
CHArS doesn’t matter!

Linear models: the different scales mean different
penalty. L2 is the same for all!

We can also see non-gaussian distributions here btw!

# Scaling and Distances

![:scale 90%](images/knn_scaling.png)

???
Here is an example of the importance of scaling using a distance-based algorithm, K nearest neighbors.
My favorite toy dataset with two classes in two dimensions. The scatter plots look identical,
but on the left hand side, the two axes have very different scales. The x axis has much
larger values than the y axis.
On the right hand side, I used standard scaler and so both features have zero mean and unit
variance.
So what do you think will happen if I use k nearest neighbors here?
Let's see
---
# Scaling and Distances

![:scale 90%](images/knn_scaling2.png)

???
As you can see, the difference is quite dramatic. Because the X axis has such a larger magnitude
on the left-hand side, only distances along the x axis matter. However, the important
feature for this task is the y axis. So the important feature gets entirely ignored because
of the different scales.
And usually the scales don't have any meaning - it could be a matter of changing meters to kilometers.

# Ways to Scale Data
<br />
![:scale 80%](images/preprocessing_img_3.png)
???
StandardScaler: subtract mean, divide by standard
deviation.

MinMaxScaler: subtract minimum, divide by range.
Afterwards between 0 and 1.

Robust Scaler: uses median and quantiles, therefore
robust to outliers. Similar to StandardScaler.

Normalizer: only considers angle, not length. Helpful
for histograms, not that often used.

StandardScaler is usually good, but doesn’t guarantee
particular min and max values

class: spacious

# Sparse Data

- Data with many zeros – only store non-zero entries.
- Subtracting anything will make the data “dense” (no more zeros) and blow the RAM.
- Only scale, don’t center (use MaxAbsScaler)

???
You have to be careful if you have sparse data. Sparse
data is data where most entries of the data-matrix X
are zero – often only 1% or less are not zero.

You can store this efficiently by only storing the nonzero elements.
Subtracting the mean results in all features becoming
non-zero!

So don’t subtract anything, but you can still scale.
MaxAbsScaler scales between -1 and 1 by dividing
with the maximum absolute value for each feature.
---
# Standard Scaler Example

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
X, y = boston.data, boston.target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, random_state=0)

scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(X_train)
X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)

ridge = Ridge().fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
ridge.score(X_test_scaled, y_test)
```
```
0.634
```

???
Here’s how you do the scaling with StandardScaler in
scikit-learn. Similar interface to models, but
“transform” instead of “predict”. “transform” is always
used when you want a new representation of the
data.

Fit on training set, transform training set, fit ridge on
scaled data, transform test data, score scaled test
data.

The fit computes mean and standard deviation on the
training set, transform subtracts the mean and the
standard deviation.

We fit on the training set and apply transform on both
the training and the test set. That means the training
set mean gets subtracted from the test set, not the
test-set mean. That’s quite important.
---

class: center, middle

.center[
![:scale 100%](images/preprocessing_img_5.png)
]

???

Here’s an illustration why this is important using the
min-max scaler. Left is the original data. Center is
what happens when we fit on the training set and
then transform the training and test set using this
transformer. The data looks exactly the same, but the
ticks changed. Now the data has a minimum of zero
and a maximum of one on the training set. That’s not
true for the test set, though. No particular range is
ensured for the test-set. It could even be outside of 0
and 1. But the transformation is consistent with the
transformation on the training set, so the data looks
the same.

On the right you see what happens when you use the
test-set minimum and maximum for scaling the test
set. That’s what would happen if you’d fit again on
the test set. Now the test set also has minimum at 0
and maximum at 1, but the data is totally distorted
from what it was before. So don’t do that.

# Sckit-Learn API Summary

![:scale 80%](images/api-table.png)


???

Here’s a summary of the scikit-learn methods.
All models have a fit method which takes the training data X_train. If
the model is supervised, such as our classification and regression
models, they also take a y_train parameter. The scalers don’t use
a y_train because they don’t use the labels at all – you could say
they are unsupervised methods, but arguably they are not really
learning methods at all.
Models (also known as estimators in scikit-learn) to make a
prediction of a target variable, you use the predict method, as in
classification and regression.
If you want to create a new representation of the data, a new kind of
X, then you use the transform method, as we did with scaling. The
transform method is also used for preprocessing, feature
extraction and feature selection, which we’ll see later. All of these
change X into some new form.
There’s two important shortcuts. To fit an estimator and immediately
transform the training data, you can use fit_transform. That’s often
more efficient then using first fit and then transform. The same
goes for fit_predict.

Let’s apply the scaler to the Boston housing data.

First I used the StandardScaler to scale the training
data. Then I applied ten-fold cross-validation to
evaluate the Ridge model on the data with and
without scaling. I used RidgeCV which automatically
picks alpha for me. With and without scaling we get
an R^2 of about .72, so no difference. Often there is
a difference for Ridge, but not in this case.

If we use KneighborsRegressor instead, we see a big
difference. Without scaling R^2 is about .5, and with
scaling it’s .75. That makes sense since we saw that
for distance calculations basically all features are
dominated by the TAX feature.

However, there is a bit of a problem with the analysis
we did here. Can you see it?


# Feature Distributions

???

Now that we discussed scaling and pipelines, let’s talk
about some more preprocessing methods. One
important aspect is dealing with different input
distributions.

.center[
![:scale 85%](images/preprocessing_img_17.png)
]

???

Here is a box plot of the boston housing data after
transforming it with the standard scaler. Even though
the mean and standard deviation are the same for all
features, the distributions are quite different. You can
see very concentrated distributions like Crim and B,
and very skewed distribuations like RAD and Tax
(and also crim and B).

Many models, in particular linear models and neural
networks, work better if the features are
approximately normal distributed.

Let’s also check out the histograms of the data to see
a bit better what’s going on.

---

class: left, middle

.center[
![:scale 90%](images/boston_hist.png)
]

???

Clearly CRIM and ZN and B are very peaked, and
LSTAT and DIS and Age are very asymmetric.
Sometimes you can use a hack like applying a
logarithm to the data to get better behaved values.
There is slightly more rigorous technique though.

# Power Transformations (Box-Cox & Yeo-Johnson)
.left-column[
$$bc_{\lambda}(x) = \cases{\frac{x^\lambda - 1}{\lambda} & \text{if } \lambda \neq 0\cr log(x) & \text{if } \lambda = 0 }$$
]

.right-column[
![:scale 90%](images/preprocessing_img_19.png)
]

.reset-column[
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import PowerTransformer
# Use "yeo-johnson" for positive+negative data
pt = PowerTransformer(method='box-cox')
pt.fit(X)
```
]
???


The Box-Cox transformation is a family of univariate
functions to transform your data, parametrized by a
parameter lambda. For lamda=1 the function is the
identity, for lambda = 2 it is square, lambda =0 is log
and there is many other functions in between. For a
given dataset, a separate parameter lambda is
determined for each feature, by minimizing the
skewdness of the data (making skewdness close to
zero, not close to -inf), so it is more “gaussian”. The
skewdness of a function is a measure of the
asymmetry of a function and is 0 for functions that
are symmetric around their mean.
Unfortunately the Box-Cox transformation is only
applicable to positive features.

]

.narrow-right-column[Before]
.clear-column[]

.wide-left-column[![:scale 85%](images/boston_hist_boxcox.png)]
.narrow-right-column[After]


???

Here are the histograms of the original data and the
transformed data. The title of each subplot shows the
estimated lambda. If the lambda is close to 1, the
transformation didn’t change much. If it is away from
1, there was a significant transformation.

You can clearly see the effect on “CRIM” which was
approximately log-transformed, and lstat and nox
which were approximately transformed by sqrt.

For the binary CHAS the transformation doesn’t make
a lot of sense, though.

.narrow-right-column[After]



???

Here is a comparison of the feature vs response plot
before and after the box-cox transformation.

The dis, lstat and crim relationships now look a bit
more obvious and linear.

# Categorical Variables

.larger[
$$ \lbrace 'red', 'green', 'blue' \rbrace \subset ℝ^p ? $$

???

Before we can apply a machine learning algorithm, we
first need to think about how we represent our data.

Earlier, I said x \in R^n. That’s not how you usually get
data. Often data has units, possibly different units for
different sensors, it has a mixture of continuous
values and discrete values, and different
measurements might be on totally different scales.

First, let me explain how to deal with discrete input
variables, also known as categorical features. They
come up in nearly all applications.

Let’s say you have three possible values for a given
measurement, whether you used setup1 setup2 or
setup3. You could try to encode these into a single
real number, say 0, 1 and 2, or e, \pi, \tau.

However, that would be a bad idea for algorithms like
linear regression

# Categorical Variables
.center[![:scale 60%](images/preprocessing_img_24.png)]

???

If you encode all three values using the same feature,
then you are imposing a linear relation between
them, and in particular you define an order between
the categories. Usually, there is no semantic ordering
of the categories, and so we shouldn’t introduce one
in our representation of the data.

Instead, we add one new feature for each category,

And that feature encodes whether a sample belongs to
this category or not.

That’s called a one-hot encoding, because only one of
the three features in this example is active at a time.

You could actually get away with n-1 features, but in
machine learning that usually doesn’t matter
