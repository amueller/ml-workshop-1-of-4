Today we’ll talk about preprocessing and featureengineering. What we’re talking about today mostly
applies to linear models, and not to tree-based
models, but it also applies to neural nets and kernel
SVMs.

Let’s start with the different scales.

Many model want data that is on the same scale.
KNearestNeighbors: If the distance in TAX is
between 300 and 400 then the distance difference in
CHArS doesn’t matter!

Linear models: the different scales mean different
penalty. L2 is the same for all!

We can also see non-gaussian distributions here btw!

# Scaling and Distances

![:scale 90%](images/knn_scaling.png)

???
Here is an example of the importance of scaling using a
distance-based algorithm, K nearest neighbors. My favorite
toy dataset with two classes in two dimensions. The scatter
plots look identical, but on the left hand side, the two
axes have very different scales. The x axis has much larger
values than the y axis. On the right hand side, I used
standard scaler and so both features have zero mean and unit
variance. So what do you think will happen if I use k
nearest neighbors here? Let's see
---
# Scaling and Distances

![:scale 90%](images/knn_scaling2.png)

???
As you can see, the difference is quite dramatic. Because
the X axis has such a larger magnitude on the left-hand
side, only distances along the x axis matter. However, the
important feature for this task is the y axis. So the
important feature gets entirely ignored because of the
different scales. And usually the scales don't have any
meaning - it could be a matter of changing meters to
kilometers.
Linear models: the different scales mean different penalty.
L2 is the same for all!

# Ways to Scale Data
<br />
![:scale 80%](images/scaler_comparison_scatter.png)
???
Here's an illustration of four of the most common ways. One
of the most common ones that we already saw before is the
Standard Scaler. StandardScaler subtracts the mean and
divides by standard deviation. Making all the features have
a zero mean and a standard deviation of one. One thing about
this is that it won't guarantee any minimum or maximum
values. The range can be arbitrarily large. MinMaxScaler
subtracts minimum and divides by range. Scales between 0 and 1.
So all the features will have an exact minimum at zero
and exact maximum at one. This mostly makes sense if there
are actually minimum and maximum values in your data set.
If it's actually Gaussian distribution, the scaling might
not make a lot of sense, because if you add one more data
point, it's very far away and it will cram all the other
data points more together. This will make sense if you have
a grayscale value between 0 and 255 or something else that
has like clearly defined boundaries. Another alternative is
the RobustScaler. It’s the robust version of the
StandardScaler. It computes the median and the quartiles.
This cannot be skewed by outliers. The StandardScaler uses
mean and standard deviation. So if you have a point that’s
very far away, it can have unlimited influence on the mean.
The RobustScaler uses robust statistics, so it’s not skewed
be outliers. The final one is the Normalizer. This projects
things either on the L1 or L0, meaning it makes sure to
vectors have length one either in L1 norm or L2 norm. If you
do this for L2 norm, it means you don't care about the
length you project on a circle. More commonly used in L1
norm, it projects onto the diamond. What that does is
basically it means you make sure the sum of all the entries
is one. That's often used if you have histograms or if you
have counts of things. If you want to make sure that you
have frequency features instead of count features, you can
use the L1 normalizer.

# Sparse Data

- Data with many zeros – only store non-zero entries.
- Subtracting anything will make the data “dense” (no more zeros) and blow the RAM.
- Only scale, don’t center (use MaxAbsScaler)

???

FIXME ugly slide
There’s another one that's important for sparse data. It’s
called the MaxAbsScaler in scikit-learn. So sparse data is
the kind of data that happens actually quite frequently in
practice where most of the features are zero most of the
time. So if you have tens of thousands of features, but
they're always nearly zero. For example, you can think about
these being particular user actions and at any time, any
user makes only very few actions. But there are many, many
possibilities. So if you have data like that, you only want
to store the non-zero values, you don't want to store all
the zeros. If you would store all the zeros, the data
wouldn't even fit into the RAM often. So you have this very
large sparse data set and you want to scale it, but if you
subtract anything from it, if you want to make it zero mean
then all the entries will be non-zero because the chance
that the mean is actually zero is small. So then if you
subtract something from everything, you're going to move all
those zeros away from zero and then you can't store the data
in sparse format and your RAM will blow up. Basically, you
can subtract anything from sparse matrix because that won't
be sparse anymore. But we can still scale it because any
number of times zero is still zero. So if we scale it, then
it will have the same structure again. The MaxAbsScaler sets
the maximum absolute values to one. Basically, it looks at
the maximum absolute values in the whole dataset, or for
each feature and makes sure that this is one, just by
scaling by one divided by the maximum absolute value.

# Standard Scaler Example

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
# Back to King Country house prices
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, random_state=0)

scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(X_train)
X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)

ridge = Ridge().fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
ridge.score(X_test_scaled, y_test)
```
```
0.684
```

???
Here’s how you do the scaling with StandardScaler in
scikit-learn. Similar interface to models, but“transform”
instead of “predict”. “transform” is always used when you
want a new representation of the data.

Fit on training set, transform training set, fit ridge on
scaled data, transform test data, score scaled test data.

The fit computes mean and standard deviation on the training
set, transform subtracts the mean and the standard
deviation.

We fit on the training set and apply transform on both the
training and the test set. That means the training set mean
gets subtracted from the test set, not the test-set mean.
That’s quite important.

.center[
![:scale 100%](images/no_separate_scaling.png)
]

???

Here’s an illustration why this is important using the
min-max scaler. Left is the original data. Center is what
happens when we fit on the training set and then transform
the training and test set using this transformer. The data
looks exactly the same, but the ticks changed. Now the data
has a minimum of zero and a maximum of one on the training
set. That’s not true for the test set, though. No particular
range is ensured for the test-set. It could even be outside
of 0 and 1. But the transformation is consistent with the
transformation on the training set, so the data looks the
same.

On the right you see what happens when you use the test-set
minimum and maximum for scaling the test set. That’s what
would happen if you’d fit again on the test set. Now the
test set also has minimum at 0 and maximum at 1, but the
data is totally distorted from what it was before. So don’t
do that.

# Sckit-Learn API Summary

![:scale 90%](images/api-table.png)


???

Here’s a summary of the scikit-learn methods. All models
have a fit method which takes the training data X_train. If
the model is supervised, such as our classification and
regression models, they also take a y_train parameter. The
scalers don’t use a y_train because they don’t use the
labels at all – you could say they are unsupervised methods,
but arguably they are not really learning methods at all.
Models (also known as estimators in scikit-learn) to make a
prediction of a target variable, you use the predict method,
as in classification and regression. If you want to create a
new representation of the data, a new kind of X, then you
use the transform method, as we did with scaling. The
transform method is also used for preprocessing, feature
extraction and feature selection, which we’ll see later. All
of these change X into some new form. There’s two important
shortcuts. To fit an estimator and immediately transform the
training data, you can use fit_transform. That’s often more
efficient then using first fit and then transform. The same
goes for fit_predict.

Let’s apply the scaler to the King Country housing data.

First I used the StandardScaler to scale the training data.
Then I applied ten-fold cross-validation to evaluate the
Ridge model on the data with and without scaling. I used
RidgeCV which automatically picks alpha for me. With and
without scaling we get an R^2 of about .72, so no
difference. Often there is a difference for Ridge, but not
in this case.

If we use KneighborsRegressor instead, we see a big
difference. Without scaling R^2 is about .5, and with
scaling it’s .75. That makes sense since we saw that for
distance calculations basically all features are dominated
by the TAX feature.

However, there is a bit of a problem with the analysis we
did here. Can you see it?

Before we can apply a machine learning algorithm, we first
need to think about how we represent our data.

Earlier, I said x \in R^n. That’s not how you usually get
data. Often data has units, possibly different units for
different sensors, it has a mixture of continuous values and
discrete values, and different measurements might be on
totally different scales.

First, let me explain how to deal with discrete input
variables, also known as categorical features. They come up
in nearly all applications.

Scikit-learn requires you to explicitly handle these, and assumes
in general that all your input is continuous numbers.
This is different from how many libraries in R do it,
which deal with categorical variables implicitly.

If you encode all three values using the same feature, then
you are imposing a linear relation between them, and in
particular you define an order between the categories.
Usually, there is no semantic ordering of the categories,
and so we shouldn’t introduce one in our representation of
the data.

Instead, we add one new feature for each category,

And that feature encodes whether a sample belongs to this
category or not.

That’s called a one-hot encoding, because only one of the
three features in this example is active at a time.

You could actually get away with n-1 features, but in
machine learning that usually doesn’t matter

One way to do is with Pandas. Here I have an example of a
data frame where I have the boroughs of New York as a
categorical variable and variable saying whether they are vegan. One to get the
dummies is to get dummies on this data frame. This will
create new columns, it will actually replace borough column
by four columns that correspond to the four different
values. The get_dummies applies transformation to all
columns that have a dtype that's either object or
categorical.

In this case we didn't actually want to transform the target variable vegan.

This also helps if the variable was already encoded using integers.
Sometimes, someone has already encoded the categorical
variables to integers like here. So here this is exactly the
same information only except instead of strings you have
them numbered. If you call the get_dummies on this nothing
happens because none of them are object data types or
categorical data types. If you want to look at the One Hot
Encoding, you can explicitly pass columns equal and this
will transform into boro_1, boro_2, boro_3.
In this case get_dummies usually wouldn't do anything, but we can tell
it which variables are categorical and it will dummy encode those for us.

If someone else gives you a new data set and in this new
data set there is Staten Island, Manhattan, Bronx and
Brooklyn. So new dataset doesn't have anyone from Queens. So
now you transform this with get_dummies, you get something
that has the same shape as the original data but actually,
the last column means something completely different.
Because now the last column is Staten Island, not Queens. If
someone gives you separate training and test data sets, if
you call get_dummies, you don't know that the columns
correspond actually to the same thing. Unless you take care
of the names, unfortunately, scikit-learn completely ignores
column names.

The way to fix this is by using Pandas categorical types.
Since we know what the boroughs of Manhattan are, we can
create Pandas categorical dtype, we can create this
categorical dtype with the categories Manhattan, Queens,
Brooklyn, Bronx, and Staten Island. So now I have my column
here and I'm going to convert it to a categorical dtype. So
now it will not actually store the strings. It will just
internally store zero to four, and it will also store what
are the possible values. If a call get_dummies it will use
all the possible values and for each of the possible values
it will create a column. Even though Staten Island has not
appeared in my dataset, it will still make a column for
Staten Island. If I fix this categorical dtype I can apply
it to the training and test data set and that'll make sure
all the columns are always the same no matter what are the
values are actually in the data set.

# OneHotEncoder

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'salary': [103, 89, 142, 54, 63, 219],
                   'boro': ['Manhattan', 'Queens', 'Manhattan',
                            'Brooklyn', 'Brooklyn', 'Bronx']})

ce = OneHotEncoder().fit(df)
ce.transform(df).toarray()
```
```
array([[ 0.,  0.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  1.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  1.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 1.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  1.]])
```

- Always transforms all columns

???
- Fit-transform paradigm ensures train and test-set categories correspond.

# OneHotEncoder + ColumnTransformer

```python
categorical = df.dtypes == object

preprocess = make_column_transformer(
    (StandardScaler(), ~categorical),
    (OneHotEncoder(), categorical))

```
???
The way to use this with mixed type data is column transformer, which
allows you to transforms only some of the columns. For
example, you can call categorical encoder only on the
categorical columns and call StandardScaler on the
non-categorical columns, and then use that to preprocess
your data. Right now using Pandas, make sure your column
names match up, make everything to an integer,
or use column transformer and everything is awesome.

In contrast to basically all other estimators in sklearn,
this uses the column information in pandas and allows you to slice
out different columns based on column names, integer indices or boolean masks.
In this example I'm constructing a boolean mask

???
Here's a schematic of the column transformer.
Most commonly you might want to separate continuous and categorical columns,
but you can select any subsets of columns you like. They can also overlap.
Or you can apply multiple transformations to the same set of columns.
Let's say I want a scaled version of the data, but I also want to
extract principal components. I can use the same column as inputs to multiple
transformers, and the results will be concatenated.

# Dummy variables and colinearity

- One-hot is redundant (last one is 1 – sum of others)
- Can introduce co-linearity
- Can drop one
- Choice which one matters for penalized models
- Keeping all can make the model more interpretable

#Models Supporting Discrete Features

- In principle:
  - All tree-based models, naive Bayes
- In scikit-learn:
  - Some Naive Bayes classifiers.
- In scikit-learn "soon":
  - Decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting


???
In principle all tree-based models support categorical
features, in scikit-learn none of them do, hopefully, soon
they will. So what you can do is either you do the One Hot
Encoder or you just encode this as integers and treat it as
a continuous. If you have very high categorical variables
with many levels, maybe it keeping it as an integer might
make more sense.
