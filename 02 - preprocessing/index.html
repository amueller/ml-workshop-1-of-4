Today we’ll talk about preprocessing and featureengineering. What we’re talking about today mostly
applies to linear models, and not to tree-based
models, but it also applies to neural nets and kernel
SVMs.

Let’s go back to the boston housing dataset. The idea
was to predict house prices. Here are the features on
the x axis and the response, so price, on the y axis.

What are some thing you can notice? (concentrated
distributions, skewed distibutions, discrete variable,
linear and non-linear effects, different scales)

Let’s start with the different scales.

Many model want data that is on the same scale.
KNearestNeighbors: If the distance in TAX is
between 300 and 400 then the distance difference in
CHArS doesn’t matter!

Linear models: the different scales mean different
penalty. L2 is the same for all!

We can also see non-gaussian distributions here btw!

# Ways to Scale Data
<br />
![:scale 80%](images/img_3.png)
???
StandardScaler: subtract mean, divide by standard
deviation.

MinMaxScaler: subtract minimum, divide by range.
Afterwards between 0 and 1.

Robust Scaler: uses median and quantiles, therefore
robust to outliers. Similar to StandardScaler.

Normalizer: only considers angle, not length. Helpful
for histograms, not that often used.

StandardScaler is usually good, but doesn’t guarantee
particular min and max values

---
class: spacious

# Sparse Data

- Data with many zeros – only store non-zero entries.
- Subtracting anything will make the data “dense” (no more zeros) and blow the RAM.
- Only scale, don’t center (use MaxAbsScaler)

???
You have to be careful if you have sparse data. Sparse
data is data where most entries of the data-matrix X
are zero – often only 1% or less are not zero.

You can store this efficiently by only storing the nonzero elements.
Subtracting the mean results in all features becoming
non-zero!

So don’t subtract anything, but you can still scale.
MaxAbsScaler scales between -1 and 1 by dividing
with the maximum absolute value for each feature.
---
# Standard Scaler Example

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
X, y = boston.data, boston.target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, random_state=0)

scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(X_train)
X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)

ridge = Ridge().fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
ridge.score(X_test_scaled, y_test)
```
```
0.634
```

???
Here’s how you do the scaling with StandardScaler in
scikit-learn. Similar interface to models, but
“transform” instead of “predict”. “transform” is always
used when you want a new representation of the
data.

Fit on training set, transform training set, fit ridge on
scaled data, transform test data, score scaled test
data.

The fit computes mean and standard deviation on the
training set, transform subtracts the mean and the
standard deviation.

We fit on the training set and apply transform on both
the training and the test set. That means the training
set mean gets subtracted from the test set, not the
test-set mean. That’s quite important.
---

class: center, middle

.center[
![:scale 100%](images/img_5.png)
]

???

Here’s an illustration why this is important using the
min-max scaler. Left is the original data. Center is
what happens when we fit on the training set and
then transform the training and test set using this
transformer. The data looks exactly the same, but the
ticks changed. Now the data has a minimum of zero
and a maximum of one on the training set. That’s not
true for the test set, though. No particular range is
ensured for the test-set. It could even be outside of 0
and 1. But the transformation is consistent with the
transformation on the training set, so the data looks
the same.

On the right you see what happens when you use the
test-set minimum and maximum for scaling the test
set. That’s what would happen if you’d fit again on
the test set. Now the test set also has minimum at 0
and maximum at 1, but the data is totally distorted
from what it was before. So don’t do that.

# Sckit-Learn API Summary

![:scale 90%](images/img_6.png)

Efficient shortcuts:

```python
est.fit_transform(X) == est.fit(X).transform(X)  # mostly
est.fit_predict(X) == est.fit(X).predict(X)   # mostly
```

???

Here’s a summary of the scikit-learn methods.
All models have a fit method which takes the training data X_train. If
the model is supervised, such as our classification and regression
models, they also take a y_train parameter. The scalers don’t use
a y_train because they don’t use the labels at all – you could say
they are unsupervised methods, but arguably they are not really
learning methods at all.
Models (also known as estimators in scikit-learn) to make a
prediction of a target variable, you use the predict method, as in
classification and regression.
If you want to create a new representation of the data, a new kind of
X, then you use the transform method, as we did with scaling. The
transform method is also used for preprocessing, feature
extraction and feature selection, which we’ll see later. All of these
change X into some new form.
There’s two important shortcuts. To fit an estimator and immediately
transform the training data, you can use fit_transform. That’s often
more efficient then using first fit and then transform. The same
goes for fit_predict.

# Scaling and Distances

![:scale 90%](images/knn_scaling.png)

???
Here is an example of the importance of scaling using a distance-based algorithm, K nearest neighbors.
My favorite toy dataset with two classes in two dimensions. The scatter plots look identical,
but on the left hand side, the two axes have very different scales. The x axis has much
larger values than the y axis.
On the right hand side, I used standard scaler and so both features have zero mean and unit
variance.
So what do you think will happen if I use k nearest neighbors here?
Let's see
---
# Scaling and Distances

![:scale 90%](images/knn_scaling2.png)

???
As you can see, the difference is quite dramatic. Because the X axis has such a larger magnitude
on the left-hand side, only distances along the x axis matter. However, the important
feature for this task is the y axis. So the important feature gets entirely ignored because
of the different scales.
And usually the scales don't have any meaning - it could be a matter of changing meters to kilometers.

```

???

Let’s apply the scaler to the Boston housing data.

First I used the StandardScaler to scale the training
data. Then I applied ten-fold cross-validation to
evaluate the Ridge model on the data with and
without scaling. I used RidgeCV which automatically
picks alpha for me. With and without scaling we get
an R^2 of about .72, so no difference. Often there is
a difference for Ridge, but not in this case.

If we use KneighborsRegressor instead, we see a big
difference. Without scaling R^2 is about .5, and with
scaling it’s .75. That makes sense since we saw that
for distance calculations basically all features are
dominated by the TAX feature.

However, there is a bit of a problem with the analysis
we did here. Can you see it?

# A note on preprocessing

I want to talk a bit more about preprocessing and
cross-validation here, and introduce pipelines.

#Leaking Information

.left-column[

![:scale 100%](images/img_9.png)
]
.right-column[
No Information leakage
![:scale 100%](images/img_10.png)]

.reset-column[
Need to include preprocessing in cross-validation !
]

???

What we did was we trained the scaler on the training data,
and then applied cross-validation to the scaled data. Tha’s
what’s show on the left. The problem is that we use the
information of all of the training data for scaling, so in
particular the information in the test fold. This is also known
as information leakage. If we apply our model to new data,
this data will not have been used to do the scaling, so our
cross-validation will give us a biased result that might be
too optimistic.

On the right you can see how we should do it: we should only
use the training part of the data to find the mean and
standard deviation, even in cross-validation. That means
that for each split in the cross-validation, we need to scale
the data a bit differently. This basically means the scaling
should happen inside the cross-validation loop, not outside.

In practice, estimating mean and standard deviation is quite
robust and you will not see a big difference between the
two methods. But for other preprocessing steps that we’ll
see later, this might make a huge difference. So we should
get it right from the start.

---
class: smaller

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
X, y = boston.data, boston.target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)

scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(X_train)
X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
ridge = Ridge().fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
ridge.score(X_test_scaled, y_test)
```
```
0.634
```

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
pipe = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), Ridge())
pipe.fit(X_train, y_train)
pipe.score(X_test, y_test)
```
```
0.634
```

???

Now I want to show you how to do preprocessing and crossvalidation right with scikit-learn.

At the top here you see the workflow for scaling the data and
then applying ridge again. Fit the scaler on the training set,
transform on the training set, fit ridge on the training set,
transform the test set, and evaluate the model.

Because this is such a common pattern, scikit-learn has a
tool to make this easier, the pipeline. The pipeline is an
estimator that allows you to chain multiple transformations
of the data before you apply a final model.

You can build a pipeline using the make_pipeline function.
Just provide as parameters all the estimators. All but the
last one need to have a transform method. Here we only
have two steps: the standard scaler and ridge.

make_pipeline returns an estimator that does both steps at
once. We can call fit on it to fit first the scaler and then
ridge on the scaled data, and when we call score, it
transforms the data and then evaluates the model.

The code below is exactly equivalent to the code above, only
shorter.

---

class: left, middle

.center[
![:scale 70%](images/img_13.png)
]

???

Let’s dive a bit more into the pipeline. Here is an
illustration of what happens with three steps, T1, T2
and Classifier. Imagine T1 to be a scaler and T2 to
be any other transformation of the data.

If we call fit on this pipeline, it will first call fit on the first
step with the input X. Then it will transform the input
X to X1, and use X1 to fit the second step, T2. Then
it will use T2 to transform the data from X1 to X2.
Then it will fit the classifier on X2.

If we call predict on some data X’, say the test set, it
will call transform on T1, creating X’1. Then it will use
T2 to transform X’1 into X’2, and call the predict
method of the classifier on X’2. This sounds a bit
complicated, but it’s really just doing “the right thing”
to apply multiple transformation steps.

.padding-top[

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor
knn_pipe = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), KNeighborsRegressor())

np.mean(scores), np.std(scores)
```
```
(0.745, 0.106)
```
]
???

How does that help with the cross-validation problem?
Because now all steps are contain in pipeline, we
can simply pass the whole pipeline to crossvalidation, and all processing will happen inside the
cross-validation loop. That solve the data leakage
problem.

Here you can see how we can build a pipeline using a
standard scaler and kneighborsregressor and pass it
to cross-validation.

---

# Naming Steps

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
knn_pipe = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), KNeighborsRegressor())
print(knn_pipe.steps)
```
```
[('standardscaler', StandardScaler(with_mean=True, with_std=True)),
 ('kneighborsregressor', KNeighborsRegressor(algorithm='auto', ...))]
```

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
pipe = Pipeline((("scaler", StandardScaler()),
                 ("regressor", KNeighborsRegressor)))
```

???

But let’s talk a bit more about pipelines, because they
are great. The pipeline has an attribute called steps,
which --- contains its steps. Steps is a list of tuples,
where the first entry is a string and the second is an
estimator (model). The string is the “name” that is
assigned to this step in the pipeline. You can see
here that our first step is called “standardscaler” in all
lower case letters, and the second is called
kneighborsregressor, also all lower case letters.

By default, step names are just lowercased classnames. You can also name the steps yourself using
the Pipeline class directly. Then you can specify the
steps as tuples of name and estimator.
make_pipeline is just a shortcut to generate the names
automatically.

---

# Pipeline and GridSearchCV
.small-padding-top[
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

knn_pipe = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), KNeighborsRegressor())
param_grid = {'kneighborsregressor__n_neighbors': range(1, 10)}
grid = GridSearchCV(knn_pipe, param_grid, cv=10)
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(grid.best_params_)
print(grid.score(X_test, y_test))
```

```
{'kneighborsregressor__n_neighbors': 7}
0.60
```
]

???

These names are important for using pipelines with gridsearch. Recall that for using GridSearchCV you need to
specify a parameter grid as a dictionary, where the keys
are the parameter names. If you are using a pipeline inside
GridSearchCV, you need to specify not only the parameter
name, but also the step name – because multiple steps
could have a parameter with the same name.

The way to do this is to use the stepname, then two
underscores, and then the parameter name, as the key for
the param_grid dictionary.

You can see that the best_params_ will have this same
format.

This way you can tune the parameters of all steps in a
pipeline at once!

And you don’t have to worry about leaking information, since
all transformations are contained in the pipeline.

You should always use pipelines for preprocessing. Not only
does it make your code shorter, it also makes it less likely
that you have bugs.

# Feature Distributions

???

Now that we discussed scaling and pipelines, let’s talk
about some more preprocessing methods. One
important aspect is dealing with different input
distributions.

.center[
![:scale 85%](images/img_17.png)
]

???

Here is a box plot of the boston housing data after
transforming it with the standard scaler. Even though
the mean and standard deviation are the same for all
features, the distributions are quite different. You can
see very concentrated distributions like Crim and B,
and very skewed distribuations like RAD and Tax
(and also crim and B).

Many models, in particular linear models and neural
networks, work better if the features are
approximately normal distributed.

Let’s also check out the histograms of the data to see
a bit better what’s going on.

---

class: left, middle

.center[
![:scale 90%](images/boston_hist.png)
]

???

Clearly CRIM and ZN and B are very peaked, and
LSTAT and DIS and Age are very asymmetric.
Sometimes you can use a hack like applying a
logarithm to the data to get better behaved values.
There is slightly more rigorous technique though.

---

# Box-Cox Transform

.left-column[
$$bc_{\lambda}(x) = \cases{\frac{x^\lambda - 1}{\lambda} & \text{if } \lambda \neq 0\cr log(x) & \text{if } \lambda = 0 }$$

# soon: Yeo-Johnson
pt.fit(X)

]
???


The Box-Cox transformation is a family of univariate
functions to transform your data, parametrized by a
parameter lambda. For lamda=1 the function is the
identity, for lambda = 2 it is square, lambda =0 is log
and there is many other functions in between. For a
given dataset, a separate parameter lambda is
determined for each feature, by minimizing the
skewdness of the data (making skewdness close to
zero, not close to -inf), so it is more “gaussian”. The
skewdness of a function is a measure of the
asymmetry of a function and is 0 for functions that
are symmetric around their mean.
Unfortunately the Box-Cox transformation is only
applicable to positive features.

???

Here are the histograms of the original data and the
transformed data. The title of each subplot shows the
estimated lambda. If the lambda is close to 1, the
transformation didn’t change much. If it is away from
1, there was a significant transformation.

You can clearly see the effect on “CRIM” which was
approximately log-transformed, and lstat and nox
which were approximately transformed by sqrt.

For the binary CHAS the transformation doesn’t make
a lot of sense, though.

???

Before we can apply a machine learning algorithm, we
first need to think about how we represent our data.

Earlier, I said x \in R^n. That’s not how you usually get
data. Often data has units, possibly different units for
different sensors, it has a mixture of continuous
values and discrete values, and different
measurements might be on totally different scales.

First, let me explain how to deal with discrete input
variables, also known as categorical features. They
come up in nearly all applications.

Let’s say you have three possible values for a given
measurement, whether you used setup1 setup2 or
setup3. You could try to encode these into a single
real number, say 0, 1 and 2, or e, \pi, \tau.

However, that would be a bad idea for algorithms like
linear regression

---

class: center, middle

# Categorical Variables
.center[![:scale 60%](images/img_24.png)]

???

If you encode all three values using the same feature,
then you are imposing a linear relation between
them, and in particular you define an order between
the categories. Usually, there is no semantic ordering
of the categories, and so we shouldn’t introduce one
in our representation of the data.

Instead, we add one new feature for each category,

And that feature encodes whether a sample belongs to
this category or not.

That’s called a one-hot encoding, because only one of
the three features in this example is active at a time.

You could actually get away with n-1 features, but in
machine learning that usually doesn’t matter

# The Future
## CategoricalEncoder + ColumnTransformer

```python
categorical = df.dtypes == object

preprocess = make_column_transformer(

#OneHot vs Statisticians

- One-hot is redundant (last one is 1 – sum of others)
- Can introduce co-linearity
- Can drop one
- Choice which one matters for penalized models
- Keeping all can make the model more interpretable

#Models Supporting Discrete Features

- In principle:
  - All tree-based models, naive Bayes
- In scikit-learn:
  - None
- In scikit-learn soon:
  - Decision trees, random forests

#Count-Based Encoding

- For high cardinality categorical features
- Example: US states, given low samples
- Instead of 50 one-hot variables, one “response encoded” variable.
- For regression:
  - "people in this state have an average response of y”
- Binary classification:
  – “people in this state have likelihood p for class 1”
- Multiclass:
  – One feature per class: probability distribution
